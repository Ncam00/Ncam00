# Hey, I'm Nixon

I've recently transitioned from **real estate** into **tech**, bringing my passion for teamwork, problem-solving, and people-first collaboration along the way. Now evolving into **AI/ML engineering**, I'm building intelligent applications that solve real problems.

- **Transitioned from real estate to tech** to challenge myself and future-proof my skills  
- Thrived in Dev Academy's 17-week bootcamp, where I embraced roles like **Vibes Watcher** and **Agile Facilitator**  
- Built both **individual & group projects** using modern stacks and agile workflows  
- Strong human skills: empathy, communication, conflict management, and keeping team energy high  
- **Recent focus:** Building AI-powered applications with LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic workflows
